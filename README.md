Summary
The UFO webpage provides an excellent overview of UFO sightings in the US. The filtering system allows the users to filter the table by the data, city, state, country, and shape. Like most web pages, one of the UFO web page's shortcomings is that it does not have the capacity to add live data. The data does not change as more users use the web pages. Its data have to insert manually to keep the webpage update. For the web page to be competitive in the nearest future  a new system should be in place to automatically upload new data.
